**OUTGOING**

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out about this authentication issue. Based on your description, this appears to be a cookie domain configuration problem in your multi-domain setup.

To resolve this, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Clear problematic cookies**: Users currently stuck in the loop will need to clear their browser cookies for both domains (`www.domain.com` and `coach.domain.com`). You can guide them to do this manually or implement a client-side solution to remove these cookies programmatically.

2. **Configure cookie domain properly**: Ensure your Supabase client is configured to set cookies with the parent domain (`.domain.com`) rather than specific subdomains. This can be done by setting the `cookieOptions.domain` parameter when initializing your Supabase client:

```javascript
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {
  auth: {
    cookieOptions: {
      domain: '.domain.com'
    }
  }
})
```

3. **Update redirect URLs**: Verify that all necessary domains (`www.domain.com`, `coach.domain.com`, etc.) are properly listed in your allowed redirect URLs in the Supabase Dashboard under Authentication settings.

4. **Handle rate limiting**: The 429 errors should resolve once the cookie issue is fixed, as they're being caused by the continuous refresh attempts. You may want to implement client-side logic to detect and handle rate limit errors gracefully.

For immediate relief, you could implement a client-side solution to clear all Supabase auth cookies when a 429 error is detected, similar to:

```javascript
if (error && error.status === 429) {
  document.cookie = 'sb-auth-token=; domain=.domain.com; path=/; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT';
  document.cookie = 'sb-auth-token=; domain=.www.domain.com; path=/; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT';
  document.cookie = 'sb-auth-token=; domain=.coach.domain.com; path=/; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT';
  // Redirect to login page or handle as needed
}
```

Please let us know if you need further assistance with implementing these changes or if you encounter any other issues.

Best regards,
